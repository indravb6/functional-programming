Give the type of, and define the function iter so that
â€¢ iter n f x = f (f (... (f x)))
where f occurs n times on the right-hand side of the equation. For instance, we
should have
iter 3 f x = f (f (f x))
and iter 0 f x should return x

iter :: Int -> (x -> x) -> x -> x

iter n f x = f (iter (n - 1) f x)
